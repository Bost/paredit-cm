# 0.1.1
* FIX: backward-delete failed to recognize an opening bracket of a non-empty form and was deleting it instead of stopping. Interestingly, this was already covered in the unit tests and passed in 0.1.0. Need to investigate why it passed the unit tests.
* Update dependencies

# 0.1.0
* Initial version on clojars
